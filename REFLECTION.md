# Reflection

## Were your predictions right?
Some of my predictions were wrong. I expected higher caffeine to improve focus, but the data showed that my focus was often better on low-caffeine days.

## What surprised you?
I was surprised that my best focus days were not the ones with the most screen time or caffeine.

## What was tricky or rewarding?
Tracking patterns across multiple data points was tricky but rewarding once the functions started working.

## How did using your own data change things?
Using my own data made the results more interesting and meaningful because the insights applied directly to my habits.
